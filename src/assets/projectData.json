The main part of the website is built with Vue.js, I coded the web design and made it responsive from scratch (no styling framework), I also designed the illustration used in the home page. The cascading transition is inspired by PagePiling.js but since they don't seem to have a Vue port, I decided to code it from scratch. The blog side of the website is built with Gatsby.js, a static site generator based on react, I decided to do it with Gatsby since I want my blog to have great SEO, so people can find them through search engine. I might later migrate it to either Next.js or Nuxt.js.",
